<h4>MANAGE ALL INCOMING PACKAGES</h4>
Keep tabs on your deliveries by adding your packages to the "My Packages" screen.

<h4>ADD NEW PACKAGES</h4>
Simply copy and paste a tracking number from an email or website — or type it in manually. Give the package a name, and never think of that long number again.

Authentication of a user's account uses Boston College IT's API and is subject to the university's Privacy Policy accessible at https://www.bc.edu/offices/policies/universitypolicies.html

PackTrack uses the ShipIt API to fetch the shipping carrier, status, and location of a package. For more information, visit https://www.npmjs.com/package/shipit
