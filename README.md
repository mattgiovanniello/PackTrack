<h2>App Features</h2>

<h4>LOGIN WITH YOUR BC ACCOUNT</h4>

<h4>MANAGE ALL INCOMING PACKAGES</h4>
Keep tabs on your deliveries by adding your packages to the "My Packages" screen.

<h4>ADD NEW PACKAGES</h4>
Simply copy and paste a tracking number from an email or website — or type it in manually. Give the package a name, and never think of that long number again.

See exactly where your package is in real-time on the Package Details screen. Plus, detailed location and expected delivery date for in transit packages are shown for supported carriers.

<h4>PICKUP DETAILS</h4>
Once your package is Ready for Pickup, easily access the mailroom location and shelf number right in the app. No need to search through emails to dig up this info.
